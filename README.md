Path Finder
Path Finder is a Java-based project that helps you find the shortest route between cities. With this project, you can upload your city network from a CSV file and then find the shortest route between any two cities using BFS and DFS algorithms.

Features
Graph Representation: Uses an adjacency list to represent cities and distances between them.
CSV File Loader: Easily load your map from a CSV file and customize your city network.
BFS and DFS Algorithms: Finds the shortest route using both Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms.
Interactive Interface: Discover available cities and choose start and end points with a user-friendly command-line interface.
How to Use
Prepare Your Data: Create a CSV file containing city names and distances between them.
Run the Program: Execute the Java application and specify the path to your CSV file.
Explore Your Options: Discover available cities and choose your start and end points.
Find the Shortest Path: The program calculates the shortest route using both BFS and DFS algorithms.
Review Results: View the shortest route found, including distance and cities along the way.
Navigating your city network has never been easier with Path Finder. Whether you're planning a road trip or optimizing logistics, this tool will be your best companion. Explore, discover, and optimize routes with ease!
